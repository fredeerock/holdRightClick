# Hold Right Click

This application simulates holding the right mouse button after three quick left mouse clicks. It also includes a system tray icon for easy access and control. I created this for programs like Unreal Engine that don't allow users to pan the Event Graph easily without a mouse.

## Features

- Simulates holding the right mouse button after three consecutive left mouse clicks.
- Releases the right mouse button when the the user clicks again.
- System tray icon with options to start/stop the tracker and exit the application.
